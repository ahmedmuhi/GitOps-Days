## 🌟 Introduction

Let’s be honest—Kubernetes deployments can get messy fast.

You tweak a manifest, apply it to the cluster, and then check whether it actually matches what you meant to deploy. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn’t. And when things drift, break, or silently go out of sync, figuring out what changed—and when—can feel like guesswork.

**GitOps is a way out of that mess.**

At its core, GitOps is about using Git not just for your code, but for *everything*: your deployment state, your infrastructure, your configuration. You write it down, commit it, and let an automated system make sure the cluster reflects what Git says it should.

If something breaks, you roll back the commit.  
If something drifts, it gets put back automatically.

It’s simple in principle, powerful in practice, and increasingly the default for how modern teams manage cloud-native systems—especially with Kubernetes.

This isn’t just a new buzzword. It’s a shift toward working with more confidence, more visibility, and fewer surprises.

Let’s start at the beginning.

## 🔍 What Is GitOps?

At its core, **GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and application deployments using Git as the source of truth**—not just for your code, but for everything that defines how your system should run.

If you've ever written a Kubernetes manifest, stored it in a Git repo, and then applied it to a cluster, you've already brushed up against GitOps. The difference is: GitOps turns that into a repeatable system, not just a manual workflow.

Here’s the basic idea:

> You describe what your system should look like in Git.  
> A GitOps tool running inside your cluster watches that Git repo.  
> If anything changes—either in Git or in the cluster—it acts.  
> If the cluster drifts from what’s in Git, it *puts it back*.  
> If Git changes, it *pulls and applies those changes*.  
>  
> That’s the GitOps loop.

So instead of pushing changes to the cluster from your laptop or a CI job, GitOps tools **pull the desired state** from Git and make the cluster match it. If something goes wrong, you just fix it in Git—or roll back to a previous commit—and the system corrects itself.

You stop treating clusters like something you manually update.  
You start treating them like something that *follows a spec*—one that lives in Git, versioned and visible.

This changes how you think about deployments. Instead of triggering scripts, you open a pull request. Instead of debugging “who ran what when,” you look at commit history. It’s deployment by PR—and that’s the magic.

## 🔧 What Makes It GitOps?

So if GitOps isn’t just “put your YAML in Git,” what *does* make something GitOps?

The answer comes down to four principles. They were formalised by the [OpenGitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) project (under the CNCF), and they’re what set GitOps apart from just versioning your config files.

Here’s the one-liner version of each:

### 1. **Declarative**
You define what the system *should* look like. Not *how* to get there—just the end state. Think: Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize overlays. These act as a contract between you and the system.

### 2. **Versioned and Immutable**
The desired state lives in Git, where every change is tracked, reviewable, and recoverable. If something goes wrong, you just roll back to a known good commit. Git becomes your changelog, your audit trail, your recovery point.

### 3. **Pulled Automatically**
You don’t push changes into the cluster. A GitOps agent inside the cluster *pulls* updates from Git. This means no CI system needs cluster access—and your deployments are always consistent with what's committed.

### 4. **Continuously Reconciled**
The system doesn’t just apply changes once. It constantly watches for drift. If anything changes outside Git—someone tweaks something manually, something breaks, something restarts—it automatically fixes it to match what Git says should be true.

> **Git is the source of truth. The cluster follows. Always.**

## 🧭 GitOps vs DevOps, IaC, and CI/CD

At this point, you might be thinking:  
**“Isn’t this just DevOps?”**  
Or maybe:  
**“I already use Terraform and CI pipelines—how is GitOps different?”**

Totally fair questions. Let’s break it down.

### 🔄 **GitOps vs DevOps**

**DevOps** is the broad culture shift—breaking down silos between development and operations, enabling faster delivery through automation and collaboration.

**GitOps** is one *implementation pattern* within that DevOps world.  
It’s how you **operate** systems *using* Git—bringing version control, pull requests, and continuous reconciliation into the heart of your deployment workflows.

> TL;DR: GitOps doesn’t replace DevOps. It gives it teeth.

### 📜 **GitOps vs Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

With **Infrastructure as Code**, you define your infrastructure in code—Terraform files, ARM templates, Kubernetes manifests, etc.

GitOps picks up where IaC leaves off.

- **IaC** says: “This is what my infrastructure should look like.”
- **GitOps** says: “Cool, now let’s make sure it *stays* that way. Forever. Automatically.”

In other words, GitOps is what runs your infrastructure-as-code *continuously*, not just when you hit “apply.”

### ⚙️ **GitOps vs CI/CD**

In traditional **CI/CD**, your pipeline builds an artifact (CI) and often pushes it directly to your cluster (CD).

That’s the **push model**.

GitOps flips it:  
You update your Git repository, and a tool inside the cluster notices that change, pulls the updated state, and applies it.

That’s the **pull model**.

Why it matters:
- No need to grant your CI pipeline access to the cluster
- Deployments are always tied to Git history
- Rollbacks become Git rollbacks
- You can audit exactly what’s running by reading Git

> Think of GitOps as *CD via Git*, not CD via scripts or pipeline jobs.

## ✅ Why GitOps Matters: The Benefits

So, you’ve seen the big picture. But what does GitOps *actually* give you?

Here’s the real-world impact, the stuff you feel in your daily workflow:

### 🔁 **Rollbacks are easy**
Something breaks? Just revert the Git commit. No hunting for the right script. No mystery state to untangle. Rollback becomes as simple (and safe) as hitting `git revert`.

### 🔍 **Everything is traceable**
Every change goes through Git. That means:
- You know *who* changed *what*, *when*, and *why* (via commit history or PRs).
- You don’t need to guess what’s running in prod—it’s in Git.

Auditing, debugging, onboarding new teammates? All easier.

### 📦 **Consistency across environments**
Staging, testing, production—all driven by the same Git history, same manifests, same flow. No more “it works on staging but not in prod” surprises caused by drift or manual tweaks.

### 🚨 **Self-healing through reconciliation**
If someone changes something manually in the cluster—or something crashes—GitOps puts it back the way Git says it should be. Drift doesn’t just get detected. It gets corrected.

### 🔐 **Tighter security boundaries**
Your CI system doesn’t need direct access to your cluster anymore.  
Instead, Git becomes the trusted interface.  
Less exposed credentials. Smaller blast radius. Clearer ownership.

### 📈 **More confidence in automation**
You stop thinking “I hope this works” and start thinking “If it’s in Git, it’s in production.”  
You trust the pipeline. You trust the history.  
And that trust compounds over time.

TL;DR?

> **Git becomes your source of truth. Your cluster becomes a follower. Your workflows become calmer.**

## 🙅‍♂️ What GitOps Is *Not*

Let’s clear up a few things GitOps often gets mistaken for.

GitOps sounds simple on paper—“just use Git”—but it’s easy to either overhype it or miss what makes it different.

Here’s what GitOps **isn’t**:

### ❌ It’s not just “YAML in Git”

Putting your manifests in Git is a good start. But unless you have something actively watching Git and reconciling the cluster to match it, you’re not really doing GitOps.

GitOps is a *system*, not just a storage location.

### ❌ It’s not a replacement for CI/CD

GitOps doesn’t replace your CI pipeline. You still need a way to build, test, and publish artifacts.

What GitOps *does* is take over the **delivery** part—from Git to Kubernetes—using a pull-based model. Think of it as a new engine for the last stage of your pipeline.

### ❌ It doesn’t require Flux or Argo CD

These are the most popular GitOps tools—but the GitOps model is broader than any one implementation. It’s a pattern. If your setup continuously syncs your cluster state from Git, you’re in GitOps territory—whatever tool you’re using.

### ❌ It doesn’t mean you lose control of your cluster

This is a big one. GitOps doesn’t block manual changes—but it *flags* them. If someone makes an ad-hoc change in the cluster, GitOps tooling will either revert it or alert you (depending on config).

The point isn’t to lock you out. It’s to make sure *what’s in Git always wins*.

> You’re not giving up control—you’re defining it explicitly and automating its enforcement.

## 🔭 What’s Next?

Now that you’ve got the concept, it’s time to see GitOps *in action*.

Tomorrow, we’ll walk through your **first hands-on GitOps example** using [Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/). Nothing fancy—just enough to show you how GitOps behaves differently than traditional workflows.

You’ll see what happens when:
- You make a change through Git
- You *don’t* make a change through Git
- Something breaks

And you’ll watch Flux bring it back to the desired state—**automatically**.

Think of it as your first moment of GitOps magic:  
→ _You delete a pod manually… and Git puts it back._

Stay tuned. Tomorrow, your cluster starts listening to Git.
