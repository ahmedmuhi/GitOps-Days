## 🚀 Day 3 – GitOps in the Cloud with AKS: Same Magic, Bigger Stage

**Yesterday you proved GitOps works. Today, you take it to the cloud.**

Welcome back to GitOps Days! In Day 2, you built a self-healing Kubernetes system on your laptop—watching in amazement as Flux automatically fixed drift and restored deleted resources. That wasn't just a demo. That was GitOps doing exactly what it promises: maintaining your desired state no matter what.

But here's the thing: real applications don't run on your laptop. They run in the cloud.

Today, you'll take the same GitOps principles and deploy them where they belong—on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You'll see that the magic of self-healing infrastructure works identically whether it's running on your laptop or in a massive cloud datacenter. Same Git. Same Flux. Same automatic healing. Just bigger infrastructure.

### 🎯 What Changes When You Move to the Cloud?

Here's the beautiful truth: **almost nothing**.

The same Flux that ran on your laptop runs on AKS. The same Git repository structure works in the cloud. The same self-healing magic happens at scale. The core GitOps principles don't change—only the infrastructure gets bigger.

What IS different:
- **Real endpoints**: Your app gets a public IP (just by changing one line!)
- **Production bootstrap**: One command instead of three  
- **Cloud scale**: Real infrastructure with enterprise reliability

### 🗺️ Your Cloud Journey Today

In the next 45-50 minutes, you'll:

* **Provision** a production-grade AKS cluster in Azure
* **Install** Flux using the production bootstrap method
* **Deploy** the same Hello app from Day 2—but to the cloud
* **Expose** it to the internet with one simple change
* **Break** things on purpose and watch cloud-scale self-healing

By the end, you'll have proven that GitOps truly works anywhere: local or cloud, the same principles apply. Git remains your source of truth. Flux remains your enforcement engine. The only difference? The size of your playground.

### 🌟 Why This Matters

This isn't just a cloud deployment exercise. You're proving something fundamental: GitOps is truly infrastructure-agnostic. The same patterns that worked on your laptop scale seamlessly to the cloud. 

This portability is what makes GitOps so powerful. You can develop locally, test in the cloud, and deploy to production—all using the exact same GitOps workflow. No surprises. No "but it worked on my machine." Just consistent, reliable deployments everywhere.

Ready to see your local success story scale to the cloud? Let's make it happen!

## 🛠️ Section 2: Setting Up Your Cloud Environment

**Time to move from laptop to cloud. Spoiler: it's surprisingly simple.**

In the next 10 minutes, you'll create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster—the exact same type of Kubernetes you ran locally, just hosted by Azure. That's it. One resource, one cluster, ready for GitOps.

If you're thinking "but cloud setup is always complicated!"—surprise, it's not. You'll run a handful of commands, and Azure does the heavy lifting. The hardest part? Waiting 5 minutes for the cluster to provision.

> [!TIP]
> **Cost Alert**: Everything we're creating fits comfortably in Azure's free tier. The total cost for running through this tutorial should be less than a cup of coffee. We'll use the smallest viable resources and clean up at the end.

### What We're Building

```
┌─────────────────┐                      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Local    │────── Flux ─────────▶│  AKS Cluster    │
│   Machine       │     (via Git)        │  (Kubernetes)   │
└─────────────────┘                      └─────────────────┘
```

Just your machine, talking to an AKS cluster through Git and Flux. No complex architectures. No additional services. Just cloud-hosted Kubernetes ready for the same GitOps magic you saw yesterday.

Let's get your cloud cluster running...

### 2.1 Prerequisites Check

Before we dive into cloud resources, let's make sure you have everything ready. This should only take a few minutes—you likely have most of this from Days 1 and 2.

**✅ What You'll Need:**

The same tools from Day 2, plus access to Azure. That's it!

1. **Azure Account** 
   - Free tier works perfectly (includes $200 credits)
   - Sign up at [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) if needed

2. **Azure CLI** (version 2.73.0 or later)
   ```bash
   # Check your version
   az --version
   
   # Install/update if needed:
   # Windows: winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
   # macOS: brew install azure-cli
   # Linux: curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   ```

3. **Tools from Day 2** (already installed!)
   - `kubectl` - For cluster verification
   - `flux` CLI - For bootstrapping Flux
   - Git and GitHub account

4. **Login to Azure**

   Now let's connect to Azure. The login process might look different depending on your account setup:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

   **What you might see:**
   - A browser window opens for authentication
   - After signing in, you might see some "Authentication failed" messages - that's normal!
   - Then you'll see a list of available subscriptions

   For example, here's what I see (with subscription IDs anonymized):
   ```
   Authentication failed against tenant 209ec4a9-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx 'Contoso Marketing Company'
   Authentication failed against tenant 72f988bf-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx 'Microsoft'
   
   [Tenant and subscription selection]
   No     Subscription name                     Subscription ID                       Tenant
   -----  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  -----------------
   [1]    Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test                xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  Default Directory
   [2] *  Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  Default Directory
   
   Select a subscription and tenant (Type a number or Enter for no changes):
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > **About those "Authentication failed" messages**: If you have access to multiple Azure tenants (common in enterprise environments), Azure CLI tries to log into all of them. Some may require additional authentication (like MFA) that the automatic login can't complete. This is normal - just focus on the subscriptions that do appear in the list below.

   **Choose wisely**: Select a subscription where you're comfortable creating test resources. Type the number and press Enter.

   ```bash
   # Verify you're in the right subscription
   az account show --output table
   ```

   You should see your selected subscription details. Perfect!

> [!TIP]
> **Using the wrong tenant?** If you need to access a specific tenant that showed an authentication error, run:
> ```bash
> az login --tenant TENANT_ID
> ```
> This will prompt for any additional authentication that tenant requires.

**💰 Cost Reminder**: We'll create resources in the cheapest regions with minimal specs. Total cost for this tutorial: ~$2-3. We'll delete everything at the end.

That's it! With these tools ready and Azure connected, let's create your cloud infrastructure...

### 2.2 Create Your AKS Cluster

**Time to bring Kubernetes to the cloud!** In the next 7 minutes, you'll have a production-grade AKS cluster ready for GitOps.

#### Choosing Your Azure Region

First, let's pick where your cluster will live. I'm in New Zealand, so I typically use Australia East—it's the closest region with full feature availability:

```bash
# List available regions (optional - just for reference)
az account list-locations -o table | grep -E "australiaeast|australiacentral|westus2|eastus2"
```

> [!TIP]
> **Choosing a region:** Pick one close to you for lower latency during the tutorial. Popular choices:
> - **Australia East** (Sydney) - My choice from NZ
> - **East US 2** or **West US 2** - Good for Americas
> - **West Europe** - Good for Europe
> 
> Recently launched regions might lack some features, so stick with established ones for learning.

#### Create Your Resource Group

Let's create a container for all your cloud resources:

```bash
# Set your location (I'm using Australia East)
LOCATION="australiaeast"
RESOURCE_GROUP="gitops-prod-rg"

# Create the resource group
az group create \
  --name $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --location $LOCATION
```

You'll see JSON output confirming creation. Perfect!

#### Create Your AKS Cluster

Now for the main event—your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# This takes about 5-7 minutes
az aks create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name gitops-prod-aks \
  --location $LOCATION \
  --kubernetes-version 1.32 \
  --node-count 2 \
  --node-vm-size Standard_B2s \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --enable-managed-identity
```

**What we're building:**
- **Kubernetes 1.32**: Latest LTS version for stability
- **1 node**: Minimum for basic dev/test perfect for learning
- **Standard_B2s**: Budget-friendly VMs perfect for learning (~$30/month each)
- **Managed Identity**: Modern authentication (no service principal hassles)

While this runs, here's what's happening behind the scenes:
- Azure provisions a fully managed control plane (you never see or pay for these nodes)
- Creates 2 worker nodes that will run ALL your workloads—both Kubernetes system pods and your applications
- Sets up networking, identity, and monitoring

> [!NOTE]
> **About node pools:** AKS creates a "system" node pool by default. Despite the name, it runs everything—system components AND your apps. In production, you might separate these, but one pool is perfect for learning.

#### Connect to Your Cluster

Once creation completes, you need to configure `kubectl` to talk to your new AKS cluster. Let's grab the cluster credentials:

```bash
# This downloads the cluster credentials and merges them into your kubectl config
az aks get-credentials \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name gitops-prod-aks \
  --overwrite-existing
```

What just happened? This command:
- Downloaded the connection details for your AKS cluster
- Merged them into your local `~/.kube/config` file
- Set this cluster as your current kubectl context

Now your `kubectl` commands will talk directly to your AKS cluster in the cloud, not your local cluster from Day 2!

> [!TIP]
> **Switching contexts:** If you want to switch back to your local cluster later, use:
> ```bash
> kubectl config get-contexts              # List all contexts
> kubectl config use-context kind-gitops-loop-demo  # Switch to Day 2 cluster
> kubectl config use-context gitops-prod-aks        # Switch back to AKS
> ```

#### Verify Everything Works

Let's make sure your cluster is healthy:

```bash
# Check your nodes
kubectl get nodes

# You should see something like:
# NAME                              STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
# aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.32.x
```

Both nodes showing "Ready"? Excellent! Your production Kubernetes cluster is live.

```bash
# Quick cluster info
kubectl cluster-info
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You now have a production-grade AKS cluster running in the cloud. 

**What you just built:**
- ✅ A managed Kubernetes cluster with 99.95% SLA
- ✅ Automatic updates and security patches
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and diagnostics
- ✅ Total cost: ~$2-3 for this tutorial (we'll delete it later)

Next up: Installing Flux on your cloud cluster—same tool, bigger infrastructure...

## 🚀 Section 3: Installing Flux on Your Cloud Cluster

**Remember yesterday's manual Flux installation? Today you'll do it the production way—one command instead of three.**

In Day 2, you installed Flux piece by piece to understand how it works. You ran `flux install`, then `flux create source git`, then `flux create kustomization`. That hands-on approach was perfect for learning.

But in production? Teams want simplicity. They want one command that does everything. That's where Flux bootstrap comes in—and that's what you'll use today.

### Setting Up for Success

Let's make sure you have everything ready for a smooth installation:

1. **Your GitOps repository**
   - Still have your fork from Day 2? Great! But let's make sure it's current.
   - We'll be updating this repository throughout the series, so delete your old fork and create a fresh one:
     1. Go to [github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days)
     2. Click **Fork** → **Create fork**
   - This ensures you have all the latest Day 3 content

2. **Flux CLI installed**
   ```bash
   flux --version
   # You already have this from Day 2
   ```

3. **kubectl pointing to your AKS cluster**
   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   # Should show: gitops-prod-aks (from Section 2)
   ```

4. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Need the same `repo` permissions as Day 2
   - Lost yours? Create a new one:
     1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
     2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
     3. Give it a name like "gitops-days"
     4. Check the `repo` checkbox
     5. Click **Generate token** and save it

With these ready, let's see what makes bootstrap special.

### The Production Way: Flux Bootstrap

Remember those three commands from Day 2? Bootstrap combines them into one, plus adds something powerful—it makes Flux manage itself through GitOps.

Here's what bootstrap does:
- Installs all Flux components (like `flux install`)
- Creates a GitRepository to watch your repo (like `flux create source git`)
- Creates a Kustomization to apply configurations (like `flux create kustomization`)
- **Plus**: Commits Flux's own configuration to Git so it can manage itself

One command. Complete setup. That's production efficiency.

### Running Bootstrap

Time to experience the magic. First, let's set up your GitHub credentials:

```bash
# Set your GitHub details
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
```

Now run the bootstrap command:

```bash
flux bootstrap github \
  --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
  --repository=GitOps-Days \
  --branch=main \
  --path=examples/day3/clusters/aks \
  --personal
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--personal` flag tells Flux this is a personal account, not an organizational one. Flux will expect authentication via personal access token rather than organization-level credentials.

Once bootstrap completes, let's speed up the reconciliation:

```bash
# Create a Kustomization with 1-minute interval
flux create kustomization flux-system \
  --source=GitRepository/flux-system \
  --path="./examples/day3/clusters/aks" \
  --prune=true \
  --interval=1m \
  --export > flux-system-1m.yaml

# Update the existing Kustomization
kubectl apply -f flux-system-1m.yaml

# Clean up the temporary file
rm flux-system-1m.yaml
```

> [!TIP]
> **Faster feedback**: Bootstrap creates a 10-minute default interval. We just updated it to match Day 2's 1-minute responsiveness. This `kubectl apply` here is for Flux configuration only—your actual deployments will still happen through pure Git!

### Watch Bootstrap Work Its Magic

As bootstrap runs (about 2 minutes), here's the dance happening behind the scenes:

1. **In your cluster**: Flux components deploy to the `flux-system` namespace
2. **In your Git repo**: A new folder structure appears:
   ```
   clusters/
   └── aks/
       └── flux-system/   # Flux's configuration files
   ```
3. **The clever part**: Flux immediately starts using these files to manage itself

You can watch the progress:
```bash
flux check
```

### Understanding What Bootstrap Created

Once complete, let's see what bootstrap built for you:

```bash
# Check the components
flux get sources git
flux get kustomizations
```

You'll see:
- A `flux-system` GitRepository (watching your entire repo)
- A `flux-system` Kustomization (applying everything under `clusters/aks/`)

**Here's the key insight**: That Kustomization is watching the entire `clusters/aks/` path, not just `flux-system`. This means any folder you add under `clusters/aks/` will automatically be applied. No extra commands needed!

Right now, it's only managing Flux itself (the `flux-system` folder). But when you add your app folders in Section 4, they'll be picked up automatically. Beautiful simplicity.

### 🎯 That's It!

Your AKS cluster now has:
- ✅ Flux running and managing itself through GitOps
- ✅ A Kustomization watching `clusters/aks/` for any changes
- ✅ The same self-healing powers you saw in Day 2

But your cluster feels a bit empty, doesn't it? No applications running yet. 

Remember that Hello World app from Day 2? The one that healed itself when you deleted it? In Section 4, you'll deploy it to the cloud using the same image, just changing one line to expose it to the internet.

The best part? You won't need any new Kustomizations. Just add your app under `clusters/aks/apps/hello/` and bootstrap's existing Kustomization will handle it. Why the nested folders? Because under `apps/` you might have `hello/`, `checkout/`, `payment/`—each app in its own folder, all managed by the same GitOps loop.

Ready to see your first cloud application deploy automatically? Let's make it happen...

## 🚀 Section 4: Your First Cloud Deployment

**Time to deploy to the cloud using pure GitOps. No kubectl apply. Just Git.**

Remember that Hello World app from Day 2? The one that magically healed itself? You're about to deploy the exact same app to AKS—with just one tiny change to make it internet-accessible.

### The YAMLs You'll Deploy

Let's create the same three files from Day 2, with that one magical change:

First, create the folder structure:
```bash
# Make sure you're in your GitOps-Days repository
cd ~/GitOps-Days

# Create the nested folders (matching where Flux is watching)
mkdir -p examples/day3/clusters/aks/apps/hello
cd examples/day3/clusters/aks/apps/hello
```

Now create these three files:

**1. Create `namespace.yaml`:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: hello
```

**2. Create `deployment.yaml`:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: hello
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: wbitt/hello-world:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**3. Create `service.yaml`:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: hello
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer  # ← THE ONLY CHANGE! (was ClusterIP in Day 2)
  selector:
    app: hello
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

### Spot the Difference?

That's it! One word changed: `ClusterIP` → `LoadBalancer`. This tells AKS to:
- Create an Azure Load Balancer automatically
- Assign a public IP address
- Route internet traffic to your app

Everything else stays exactly the same. Same image. Same deployment. Same GitOps principles.

### Deploy with Git (Not kubectl!)

Now for the GitOps magic. Deploy your app using only Git:

```bash
# Add your new files
git add .

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Deploy hello app to AKS with LoadBalancer"

# Push to trigger Flux
git push origin main
```

### Watch Flux Detect Your Changes

This is where it gets exciting. Within 30 seconds, Flux will notice your commit:

```bash
# Watch Flux logs in real-time (this is new!)
flux logs --follow --tail 20
```

You'll see something like:
```
2024-12-02T10:15:30Z info GitRepository/flux-system.flux-system - stored artifact for commit 'Deploy hello app to AKS'
2024-12-02T10:15:31Z info Kustomization/flux-system.flux-system - Reconciliation finished
2024-12-02T10:15:32Z info Kustomization/flux-system.flux-system - applied 3 resources
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs once you see the reconciliation complete.

### Verify Your Deployment

Let's check what Flux created:

```bash
# See your pods running
kubectl get pods -n hello

# Check the service (this is where the magic happens!)
kubectl get svc -n hello
```

You'll see something special:
```
NAME    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
hello   LoadBalancer   10.0.123.45   20.248.xxx.xxx   80:30657/TCP   2m
```

That `EXTERNAL-IP` is your app's public address! 

> [!NOTE]
> If EXTERNAL-IP shows `<pending>`, wait 30 seconds and run the command again. Azure is provisioning your Load Balancer.

### 🌍 Access Your Cloud App

No port-forwarding needed! Just open your browser:

```bash
# Get your app's public URL
echo "http://$(kubectl get svc hello -n hello -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
```

Click that link or copy it to your browser. 

**🎉 BOOM!** Your Hello World app is running on the internet, deployed through pure GitOps!

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Note**: Your app is now publicly accessible on the internet! While this is perfect for testing, remember to clean up these resources when done. We'll delete everything safely in Section 6 to avoid any unexpected costs or security risks.

### What Just Happened?

Let's appreciate this moment:
1. You pushed YAML files to Git
2. Flux detected the change within 30 seconds
3. Flux created the namespace, deployment, and service
4. AKS provisioned a real Load Balancer with public IP
5. Your app became internet-accessible

No `kubectl apply`. No manual steps. Just Git → Flux → Cloud.

**This is the same GitOps loop from Day 2, just running at cloud scale!**

Ready to test if cloud-scale self-healing works too? Let's break some things...

## 💥 Section 5: Cloud-Scale Self-Healing

**Time for the fun part—let's break your cloud deployment and watch GitOps fix it automatically!**

In Day 2, you deleted pods and watched Flux restore them on your laptop. But does this magic work in the cloud? With public IPs? With Azure Load Balancers? 

Spoiler alert: It works even better.

### Test 1: The Emergency Scale-Down

Let's simulate someone "temporarily" scaling your deployment to zero during an incident:

```bash
# Scale to zero replicas (goodbye, app!)
kubectl scale deployment hello -n hello --replicas=0

# Watch the deployment status
kubectl get deployment hello -n hello -w
```

You'll see:
```
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello   1/1     1            1           10m
hello   0/1     0            0           10m      # Your manual change
hello   0/1     0            0           10m30s   # Flux notices...
hello   0/1     1            0           10m45s   # Flux says "nope!"
hello   1/1     1            1           11m      # Back to normal!
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching. Within 60 seconds, Flux restored your deployment!

### Test 2: The Nuclear Option

Now let's go extreme. Delete EVERYTHING:

```bash
# Delete the entire namespace (and everything in it)
kubectl delete namespace hello

# This deletes:
# ✗ Your deployment
# ✗ Your service  
# ✗ Your load balancer
# ✗ Your public IP
# ✗ Everything!
```

Now watch the magic:
```bash
# Watch Flux rebuild from scratch
watch kubectl get all -n hello
```

Every 2 seconds, you'll see the resurrection:
- First: "No resources found" (everything's gone!)
- 30 seconds later: Namespace reappears
- 45 seconds later: Deployment and pods are back
- 60 seconds later: Service and load balancer return
- 90 seconds later: New public IP assigned!

Press `Ctrl+C` when everything's back.

### Verify Your App Still Works

The ultimate test—is your app accessible again?

```bash
# Get the NEW public IP (yes, it might be different!)
kubectl get svc hello -n hello

# Get the URL
echo "http://$(kubectl get svc hello -n hello -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
```

Open that URL in your browser. Your app is back, with a fresh Azure Load Balancer and new public IP!

### What Makes This Incredible

Think about what just happened:
1. You deleted cloud infrastructure (including an Azure Load Balancer)
2. Flux detected the drift within seconds
3. Flux recreated everything automatically
4. Azure provisioned new cloud resources
5. Your app got a new public IP and kept working

**No tickets. No manual fixes. No panic.**

This is the same self-healing from Day 2, but now it's healing real cloud infrastructure. The GitOps principles scaled perfectly from your laptop to Azure.

### Watch Flux's Thought Process

Want to see Flux's logs during the healing?

```bash
# See recent Flux events
flux events --for Kustomization/flux-system

# You'll see entries like:
# Reconciliation finished in 1.2s, next run in 1m0s
# Applied 3 resources
# Namespace hello created
# Deployment hello/hello created
# Service hello/hello created
```

### The Bottom Line

Whether on your laptop or in the cloud, GitOps behaves identically:
- **Drift is temporary** - Flux always wins
- **Deletions don't stick** - Git is truth
- **Manual changes are futile** - Automation prevails

Your cloud infrastructure is now as self-healing as your local cluster was. Same principles. Same reliability. Just bigger scale.

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've proven GitOps truly works anywhere!

Ready to clean up and celebrate what you've achieved? Let's wrap this up...

## 🧹 Section 6: Cleanup & Next Steps

**Time to clean up your cloud resources and celebrate what you've achieved!**

### Delete Your Azure Resources

Let's remove everything to avoid any charges:

```bash
# Delete the entire resource group (and everything in it)
az group delete --name gitops-prod-rg --yes --no-wait

# This deletes:
# - Your AKS cluster
# - All load balancers
# - All public IPs  
# - Everything!
```

The `--no-wait` flag means you don't have to wait for deletion to complete. Azure will clean up everything in the background.

### 🎉 And With That... Day 3 is Complete!

What an incredible journey from laptop to cloud. Let's take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished.

**You started with**: A working GitOps setup on your laptop (Day 2)  
**You ended with**: The exact same GitOps running on Azure Kubernetes Service

You proved that GitOps is truly portable:
- ✅ Same Flux tool (just bootstrap vs manual install)
- ✅ Same Git repository structure  
- ✅ Same self-healing behavior
- ✅ Same drift correction
- ✅ Only difference: `LoadBalancer` instead of `ClusterIP`

### The Power of What You Built

Think about this—you deployed a cloud application without:
- ❌ Learning cloud-specific deployment tools
- ❌ Writing cloud-specific configurations
- ❌ Changing your GitOps workflow
- ❌ Using `kubectl apply` even once

Your local knowledge scaled perfectly to the cloud. That's the promise of GitOps delivered.

### Your GitOps Capabilities Now

After three days, you can confidently:
- **Explain** GitOps principles to anyone (Day 1 knowledge)
- **Build** self-healing Kubernetes systems from scratch (Day 2 skills)
- **Deploy** to any Kubernetes cluster—local or cloud (Day 3 proof)
- **Trust** that your infrastructure will never drift
- **Sleep** peacefully knowing Git is your source of truth

You're no longer just GitOps-curious. You're GitOps-capable.

### Your Journey So Far

Let's see how far you've come:

**Day 1**: Understood why GitOps exists and how it solves drift  
**Day 2**: Built self-healing infrastructure on your laptop  
**Day 3**: Proved the same patterns work identically in the cloud

You now have hands-on proof that GitOps principles are universal. Whether you're deploying to a Raspberry Pi or a massive cloud cluster, the workflow remains the same.

### 🚀 Coming Next: Day 4 - Production GitOps Patterns

Now that you've proven GitOps works anywhere, it's time to learn how teams use it in production.

Tomorrow, we'll level up with real-world patterns:
- **Azure Container Registry**: Host your own images securely
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automate image builds and deployments  
- **Multi-environment workflows**: Dev, staging, and production
- **Secrets management**: Handle sensitive data the GitOps way

You've mastered the fundamentals. Tomorrow, we add the patterns that make GitOps production-ready.

### Before You Go

Did you:
- ✅ See your app running with a public IP?
- ✅ Watch Flux heal your broken deployment?
- ✅ Delete your Azure resources?
- ✅ Smile at how simple cloud deployments can be?
