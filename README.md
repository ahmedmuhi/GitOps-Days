# GitOps-Days ⏲️🚀  
*A step-by-step field guide to mastering GitOps with Kubernetes*

> **Who is this for?**  
> Developers, platform engineers, and DevOps practitioners who know the basics of containers/Kubernetes and want a structured path—from “What *is* GitOps?” to production-grade patterns.

| Day | Theme | Outcome |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Why clusters drift & what GitOps solves** | You’ll see why YAML-in-Git is *not* enough and learn the four principles that anchor every GitOps tool. |
| 2 | **Run your first GitOps loop locally** | Flux CD + Kind on your laptop; watch drift self-heal in under an hour. |
| 3 | **Scaling to the cloud (AKS)** | Configure multi-env repos, handle secrets, and deploy to Azure.*<coming soon>* |
| … | *More days pending* | Advanced patterns, policy, observability, disaster recovery. |

## How this series works
1. **One hour per day.** Every session fits in a lunch break.  
2. **Theory ➜ Practice.** You read *why* first, then feel it in a hands-on lab.  
3. **Built for iteration.** PRs are welcome—this repo itself follows GitOps.

### Prerequisites
- Docker ≥ 24  
- `kubectl` ≥ 1.27  
- Basic comfort with `git clone` & pull requests

> *New to Kubernetes?* Work through [this 20-min crash course](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) first, then come back.

## Start with Day 1
👉 **[Day-1 - What really is GitOps?](Day-1-What-really-is-GitOps.md)**  
See why your cluster sometimes *lies* to you and how GitOps keeps it honest.

Happy GitOps-ing!
