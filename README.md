# GitOps-Days ⏲️🚀

> **"GitOps: Infrastructure that heals itself."**

## 👋 Welcome

**You're about to transform how you manage Kubernetes.**

Welcome to **GitOps-Days**, a hands-on learning journey that transforms how you manage Kubernetes infrastructure. In just 5 focused sessions, you'll build systems that automatically detect drift, heal themselves, and give you back your weekends.

**If you've ever…**

* Found your production cluster mysteriously out of sync with Git—and spent hours playing detective
* Made a "quick fix" at 3am that saved the day but haunts your documentation
* Watched a carefully planned deployment unravel because someone ran an undocumented `kubectl` command
* Wished your infrastructure could just fix itself when things drift

**Then GitOps-Days is exactly where you need to be.**

No more manual `kubectl apply`. No more configuration drift anxiety. Just infrastructure that stays in sync with Git, automatically.

## 🚀 Start Your Journey

**Ready to begin?** Jump straight to [**Day 1 – Why Your Kubernetes Clusters Drift**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-1-What-really-is-GitOps.md) and start building self-healing infrastructure.

**Want to explore the full journey?** See what's ahead below.

## 🗺️ Your GitOps Learning Path

### Journey 1: Zero to GitOps-Capable (Days 1-5) 
*Transform from GitOps-curious to GitOps-capable in one focused week*

| Day | What You'll Learn | What You'll Build |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| [**Day 1**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-1-What-really-is-GitOps.md) | Why clusters drift and how GitOps fixes it | Mental model for GitOps principles |
| [**Day 2**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-2-Building-Your-First-GitOps-Loop.md) | Your first self-healing system with Flux | Local GitOps loop that auto-corrects |
| [**Day 3**](link) | Taking GitOps to the cloud (AKS) | Production-ready cloud deployment |
| **Day 4** 🔧 | Real-world patterns & troubleshooting | Robust GitOps workflows |
| **Day 5** 📋 | Your GitOps toolkit & what's next | Complete GitOps foundation |

After Journey 1, you'll be able to:
- Explain why GitOps matters (not just what it is)
- Set up GitOps for real projects
- Handle secrets and troubleshoot issues
- Make informed decisions about tools
- Know what to learn next

### Future Journeys

**Journey 2: Team-Ready GitOps** *(Coming Soon)*  
Scale from solo success to team excellence. Multi-environments, migrations, RBAC, and collaborative workflows.

**Journey 3: Production-Grade GitOps** *(Planned)*  
Enterprise patterns, disaster recovery, compliance, and operating GitOps at scale.

As our community grows, we'll add journeys based on what you need most. Have ideas? [Let us know!](link-to-discussions)
