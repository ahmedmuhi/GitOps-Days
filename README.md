# GitOps-Days ‚è≤Ô∏èüöÄ

> **"GitOps: Infrastructure that heals itself."**

## üëã Welcome

**You're about to transform how you manage Kubernetes.**

Welcome to **GitOps-Days**, a hands-on learning journey that transforms how you manage Kubernetes infrastructure. In just 5 focused sessions, you'll build systems that automatically detect drift, heal themselves, and give you back your weekends.

**If you've ever experienced any of these scenarios:**

* **The Mystery Mismatch:** Your Git repository says the app should have 3 replicas, but somehow it's running 5 in production‚Äîand nobody knows who changed it or when

* **The Undocumented Fix:** You got paged at night, fixed a critical issue directly on the cluster, meant to update the documentation later... but in the rush of the next day, it never happened. Now that fix lives only in the cluster

* **The Surprise Breaking Change:** Your deployment failed because someone manually tweaked a ConfigMap last week for a quick test‚Äîand now production depends on that undocumented change

* **The Sync Uncertainty:** You know your clusters have drifted from your Git configs, but you're hesitant to reconcile them because you can't predict what might break

**Then GitOps-Days is exactly where you need to be.**

If you relate to any of these situations‚Äîor if you just want to prevent them from happening‚Äîyou're in the right place.

No more manual `kubectl apply`. No more configuration drift. Just infrastructure that stays in sync with Git, automatically.

## üéØ What You'll Achieve

In just 5 focused sessions (one hour each), you'll go from GitOps-curious to GitOps-capable:

- **Understand** why GitOps exists and how it solves drift forever (Day 1)
- **Build** your first self-healing system that auto-fixes problems (Day 2)  
- **Scale** to the cloud with production-ready patterns on AKS (Day 3)
- **Master** real-world workflows and troubleshooting techniques (Day 4)
- **Advance** with tool comparisons and your personal roadmap (Day 5)

## üöÄ Start Your Journey

‚≠ê **First:** Star this repository to get updates as new days are released!

üìñ **Then:** Jump straight to [**Day 1 ‚Äì What GitOps Really Is (And Why It Matters)**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-1-What-really-is-GitOps.md) and start building self-healing infrastructure.

**Want the full overview first?** Keep reading below.

## üó∫Ô∏è Your Complete Learning Path

### Journey 1: Zero to GitOps-Capable (Days 1-5)
*Transform from GitOps-curious to GitOps-capable in one focused week*

**Status:** Days 1-2 ready now, Days 3-5 coming soon! ‚ö°

| Day | Focus | What You'll Build |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| [**Day 1**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-1-What-really-is-GitOps.md) | **Understand:** What GitOps really is (and why it matters) | Mental model for GitOps principles |
| [**Day 2**](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/blob/main/Day-2-Building-Your-First-GitOps-Loop.md) | **Build:** Your first self-healing system with Flux | Local GitOps loop that auto-corrects |
| **Day 3** | **Scale:** Taking GitOps to the cloud (AKS) | Production-ready cloud deployment |
| **Day 4** üîß | **Operate:** Real-world patterns & troubleshooting | Robust GitOps workflows |
| **Day 5** üìã | **Advance:** Your GitOps toolkit & what's next | Complete GitOps foundation |

<summary><b>üéØ What "GitOps-Capable" means</b></summary>

After Journey 1, you'll be able to:
- Explain why GitOps matters (not just what it is)
- Set up GitOps for real projects
- Handle secrets and troubleshoot issues
- Make informed decisions about tools
- Know what to learn next

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need

**Tools to install:**
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine (‚â•24.0)
- kubectl (‚â•1.32)
- Git and a GitHub account (free tier works perfectly)
- About 4GB RAM for the local labs

**Helpful background (but not required!):**
- If you've worked with Kubernetes before, you'll feel right at home
- New to Kubernetes? No worries‚Äîwe'll guide you through what you need
- YAML experience helps, but we'll explain everything as we go

The beauty of GitOps is that it simplifies Kubernetes operations‚Äîso this might actually be a great way to deepen your K8s understanding!

## üí° How This Series Works

- **One hour per day** - Focused sessions that fit your schedule
- **Concept ‚Üí Practice** - Understand why, then build it yourself
- **Real patterns** - Production-grade approaches, not toy examples
- **Learn by doing** - Hands-on from Day 2 onward

## üí¨ Join the Conversation

This series is actively being developed!
- **Found an issue?** Let me know: [open an issue](https://github.com/ahmedmuhi/GitOps-Days/issues)
- **Have suggestions?** I'd love to hear them
- **Share your progress:** Use #GitOpsDays on social media
- More community features coming as we grow

## üöß What's Next

### Journey 2: Team-Ready GitOps *(Coming 2025)*
Scale from solo success to team excellence. Multi-environments, migrations, RBAC, and collaborative workflows.

### Journey 3: Production-Grade GitOps *(Planned)*
Enterprise patterns, disaster recovery, compliance, and operating GitOps at scale.

As our community grows, we'll add journeys based on what you need most.
